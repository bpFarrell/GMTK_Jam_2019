        "Move yourself around by swiping your mouse towards the torch you want. You should be able to kill enemies by hitting them in flight. You can tell YY where to run with your wasd keys. Please guide him out of this place. Oh, and you can't forget that darkens is deadly for his species keep him within your light radius. Thank You.",

        "The king approached me with an interesting proposition today. He has found a substance that is capable of increasing the power of darkness and decreasing the power of flame in its surroundings. I know It’s dangerous but the knowledge we could gain from this would be an indispensable benefit for our kingdom. I think i'm going to accept.",

        "The more I investigate the nature of this substance, the more it puzzles me. It almost seems to be alive.",

        "At this point I don't think I can call it a substance any more. The word life-form seems more appropriate. Fire Seems to be its natural enemy, thus; I would posit that it adapted darkness strengthening to remove light and fire in its vacinity. The effect is not very strong right now, but I can only imagine what the future holds.",

        "I’ve changed the moniker again, these things are  monstrosities. They grow stronger each day. Their presence alone is now enough to extinguish a small flame. Not only does their presence eliminate our lifelines, the monstrosities seem to eat energy beings like us. This will make them great weapons but that would require a method of control.",

        "I can find no method of controlling the monstrosities, and they are still getting stronger. I’ve brought my worries to the king but he wants me to keep researching. I've adamantly refused and have thus been put under house arrest.",

        "Should I take YY and leave the country? No. I can't. The king will never let me. I'll gather more and more torches in preparation, will it be enough? I wish I had never agreed to help the king with his self destructive research.",

        "I’ve had a new idea. If I can borrow the flame from some outside source strong enough to keep the darkness at bay, YY and I may have a chance at surviving what I fear is to come.",

        "HA HA! I solved it! I have developed a way to call to another plane, one with infinitely more energy than ours! The only problem is that a being there must volunteer to send a bit of itself here and help. If they fail or refuse, that's it, we won't have any more options.",
    
        "None of the beings have answered our plea for help. YY if you're reading this then… Im sorry, so sorry. I sent you to the torch room with no intention of joining you. I’ve shut all the doors and I’ll be fighting in the entry for as much time as I can buy you…  I guess I must have bought enough. I’m so happy you made it and so sad to know I left you alone in this world. To the being accompanying my child, thank you for accepting my selfish request. Thank you so much!",
